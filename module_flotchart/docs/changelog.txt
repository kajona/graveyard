Module Flotchart

V4.2 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW: migrated to flot 0.8
NEW: removed plugin jquery.flot.axislabels. axislables are now rendered as simple divs.
BUG: fixed width and height of charts (no overlapping anymore of two charts which are next or below each other)
BUG: using now method array_values on xAxisLabel and values array in order to "reindex" the array
